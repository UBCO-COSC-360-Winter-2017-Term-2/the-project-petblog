Users will be given the choice to create an account which will give them access to all of the sites features. These would include posting content, following other users and customizing the appearance of their own blogs. Users without accounts will be restricted from posting content, commenting on posts and creating blogs. However, they will still have the ability to view all public posts and blogs made by any account user. The goal of PetBlog is to bring all pet lovers into one online community to share and gain knowledge about our pets. Or just to enjoy cute pictures.
